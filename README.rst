------------

The project is to study cortical folding patterns thanks to deep learning tools.
MRIs are processed through BrainVISA/Morphologist tools.

Prerequisites
-------------

Anatomist parts (anatomist_tools) must run with brainvisa installed and python2

Deep learning part (preprocessing and utils) must run with python3 and works with pytorch.
